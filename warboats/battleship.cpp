// All checks return TRUE if there is an error/miss (boundaryCheck, intersectionCheck, coordinateCheck, missedHitCheck, guessMapCheck)

// For differentiating between player1 and player2 screens in terminal, you can opt to ask the player to pass it to the other and
// have a blank input through cin then clear the screen of all previous maps, etc.

 LATEST CHANGES:
 -Evan Waxman - changed the AI::TakeTurn and startGameAI methods
